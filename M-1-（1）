#I came looking for you, 詩の雪. I know you're here—don't make me find you.
#No, this isn’t me. I’ve never even heard of this site—I don’t know anything. Don’t come looking for me.
#You're not my sister, and I'm not your child.
#As my sister, you're so cold to me—you've hurt my heart.
#I hope you never see this file.
